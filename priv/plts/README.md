# Dialyzer Persistent Lookup Table (PLT) 

PLTs will be built and stored here during develop, but shouldn't be commited.

They will also be buit in the CI/CD pipeline and cached so that the build won't take so long.
See `.github/workflows/elixir.yml` to see how that's being done in the GitHub actions.
